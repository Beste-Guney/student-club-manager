# Plans for the project:

There will be two main actors in the system: Clubs and Students.

#### Club System:

* There will be a club registeration. For already existing clubs, they will be able to register the club for the first
  time and also if a new club opens they also will be able to register their club to the system. While registering for
  the first time, the system will require a password and a name.
* Clubs will have a profile. In this profile, they will have url links to whatsapp, instagram, twitter, mail and etc. In
  addition to that, their activity calendar will be on this profile. Clubs will have forums inside their profile. Inside
  this profile members of the clubs will be seen.
* Clubs will be able to create and post new events. Each event will have a forum and participants list. After the event,
  clubs can upload media like pictures or videos to the event detail.
* There will be a notification menu for clubs and each reported forum message will be shown here. Also forum posts will
  be notified.
* Clubs will hold the participants and their related GE250 information for events.
* Club will have a page in which they will hold club records and folders. For example, when board members have a meeting
  document they will be able to upload there.
